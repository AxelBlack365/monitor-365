üìö**Product Description**

**https://www.monitor-365.com/**

Monitor 365 utilizes globally distributed nodes to simulate user visits, combined with technologies such as fingerprint recognition, web crawlers, and vulnerability scanning. It periodically collects data from target websites and conducts comprehensive analyses from multiple perspectives, including **availability, certificates, domains, DNS, tech stacks, external links, keywords (in development), sensitive information (in development), and vulnerabilities (in development)**.
The platform proactively identifies potential threats or anomalies that could compromise website availability and security. By delivering real-time alerts, it empowers users to address issues swiftly, ensuring the stability, resilience, and overall health of their websites.

üîÄ**Full Workflow**

After users configure the target website, Monitor 365 initiates periodic monitoring tasks. Based on task results, it automatically detects incidents that could compromise the website‚Äôs health, classifies them by severity, and sends alert notifications based on the criticality of each issue. This streamlined approach empowers users to maintain comprehensive oversight of their website‚Äôs security posture and overall performance.
